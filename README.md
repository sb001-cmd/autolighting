In this project i have developed an automatic street lighing system. The hardware requiremenets are Rasberry Pi , LDR sensor, Relay module for switching on/off ,LoRa Module for controlling msystem upto distance more than 1km, Power Supply,LED.
Working: First, LDR sensor detects ambient light levels and sends analog data to the microcontroller, the microcontroller reads the LDR value and compares it with  predefined thresholds (darkThreshold and brightThreshold) which accordingly activates/deactivates  relay to control the street light. LoRa module Sends real-time data (LDR value and light status) to a remote receiver (up to 1 km or more). Hence, Relay switches the street light ON/OFF based on the microcontroller's output.
